# Installation instructions
## Local OSX requirements
### Homebrew and Cask
Installing [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/):
```bash
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

Installing [Cask](https://github.com/caskroom/homebrew-cask):
```bash
brew install caskroom/cask/brew-cask
```

> In case a problem arise, you can use a `tap` (a specific brew formula):
> ```bash
> brew update
> brew uninstall brew-cask
> brew untap caskroom/cask
> brew tap caskroom/cask
> brew install brew-cask
> ```

Upgrading and updating formulas:
```bash
brew update
brew upgrade
brew cask update
```

### Installing a server locally: VirutalBox, Vagrant and Ubuntu
DevOps methodology favors local installation mirroring metal ones. This is
achieved by recreating a full virtualized server locally that mimics the
behavior of the real server.

Installing [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) and [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/):
```bash
brew cask install virtualbox
brew cask install vagrant
```

### Installing SaltStack
[SaltStack](http://saltstack.com/) is a deployment and orchestration
set of utilities. Very close to OpenStack, Chief, Puppet, Ansible, ...
Based on Python, it has been available for a long time and is used as the
first DevOps tools for company such as LinkedIn, Twitter, Rackspace, Nasa, Hulu
on their large scale infrastructure.

[SaltStack](http://saltstack.com/) offers a great advantage over its competitors
in terms of ease of setup and environment agnosticism, making it capable of
pouring a simple VM, a bare metal server, an hosted cloud solution or a
dedicated cloud infrastructure without modifying the recipes that you've
written. It can even handle container based hosting solutions that relies on
[Docker](https://www.docker.com/).

```bash
brew install saltstack
```

In case multiple instances would be required, I strongly recommend increasing
the default number of files that OSX can handle:
```bash
sudo launchctl limit maxfiles 4096 8192
```

> Why not Docker? Docker based deployment could be a great
  alternative to VirtualBox, Vagrant and SaltStack as far as
  the chosen hosting solution is able to handle Docker. OVH
  provides capabilities of using Docker throughout its RunAbove
  offer. Unfortunately and though, very solid,this offer is not
  yet ready for production and is offered as a beta service.


### Installing Meteor
This application is based on [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/).
Its installation is done in single command line, providing every bits of it
(MongoDB, NodeJS, the Meteor's framework):
```bash
curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh
```

### Getting the latest application code
The application's source code is publicly available on [Github](https://github.com/). For fetching the source, it is
preferable to use the `git` command:
```bash
brew install git
```

Now, fetching the source is easily achieved via:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Benczyk/foliom.git
```

### Installing NodeJS and demeteorizer
We use NodeJS as an utility belt launcher:
```bash
brew install nodejs
```

The utility we need is **demeteorizer**:
```bash
npm -g install demeteorizer
```

> We could use the command `meteor build`. Unfortunately, this command relies
  on Meteor's build infrastructure in the cloud. `demeteorizer` embeds all
  utilities on you local development platform, speeding up the provisionning
  workflow.

## Running the application
### As part of your OSX environment
Hop in the source repository and launch [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/):
```bash
cd foliom/app
meteor
open http://localhost:3000
```

### Build the application for the servers
A handy `build.sh` script is setup to build the application:
```bash
./build.sh
```

### Launch the local virtualized server
The VM uses the following characteristics:
* Hardware (based on [OVH's VPS classic](https://www.ovh.com/us/vps/vps-classic.xml)):
  * Single core 64bits processor
  * 1GB memory
  * 10GB HDD storage (Note that no limit is set here in the VM. 10GB is far
    more than what is required for this application to function properly).
* Software:
  * Ubuntu Server AMD64 bits 14.04 LTS
  * Apache 2.4.7
  * OpenSSH 1:6.6p1
  * fail2ban 0.8.11

The added packages are as following:
* MongoDB 2.4.12
* NodeJS 0.10.33 & npm 1.4.28

The complete configuration of the server is achieved and stored with
the `Vagranfile` and the `vagrant` utility:
```bash
vagrant up
```

> Download of the VM starting image is only done the first time. In case, an
> installation problem arise, you can destroy the currently configured VM and
> recreate one using the following commands:
> ```bash
> vagrant destroy
> vagrant up
> ```

Once downloaded and installed, you can check the VM installation by opening
an SSH session into it:
```bash
vagrant ssh
```

Shutting down the VM is achieved via:
```bash
vagrant halt
```

If you've already installed a VM and want to update it, you provision
it using the following command:
```bash
vagrant provision
```

> When installing a package on an Ubuntu server, you can check it using the
> Debian query package command:
> ```bash
> dpkg -l | grep PACKAGE_NAME
> ```

### Update the real server through SSH
@TODO

### Install ePortfolio
@TODO Need a reboot of the server owing to kernel and PAM configuration
@TODO PM2
